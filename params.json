{"name":"Layout dexter","tagline":"Super awesome + simple layouts for iOS applications views written in JSON","body":"Layout Dexter\r\n=============\r\n\r\nSuper awesome layouts for iOS apps written in JSON! \r\n\r\nKey Features\r\n  * Layouts specified in JSON\r\n  * Can work with local and remote layout files\r\n  * Hot UI/UX Push : Inject layouts post builds\r\n    * Hot pushes from remote services/API\r\n    * eg. List view being returned as JSON from a feeds API?!\r\n  * Subset of UIElements supported\r\n  * TODO: Add more comprehensive support\r\n  * TODO: Add support for interactions/events\r\n  * TODO: Add thorough parse checking\r\n  * TODO: Add extensions for user defined parsers for JSON properties/classnames\r\n  * TODO: Add support for advanced text layouting into multiple columns using CoreText\r\n\r\nUsage\r\n==========\r\nAdd SBDynamicLayoutView.h/SBDynamicLayoutView.m to your project and #include them in the ViewController you want to add the layouts too.\r\n\r\n```\r\n    SBDynamicLayoutView* dynamicLayout = [[SBDynamicLayoutView alloc] initWithFrame:self.view.bounds];\r\n    NSString* path = [[NSBundle mainBundle] pathForResource:@\"layout\" ofType:@\"json\"];\r\n    NSData* response =[[NSMutableData alloc] initWithContentsOfFile:path];\r\n    [dynamicLayout initWithJson:[NSJSONSerialization JSONObjectWithData:response options:NSJSONReadingMutableLeaves error:Nil]];\r\n    [self.view addSubview: dynamicLayout];\r\n```\r\n\r\nTake a look at `layout.json` for a simple layout\r\n\r\nNote the use of `children_remote`  to refer to a JSON file on a remote URL. \r\n\r\n\r\nAbout Layout Dexter\r\n===================\r\n\r\nLayout Dexter is based on a dinner table discussion and some hacking around.\r\nThe code is more of a proof of concept. I would be spending roughly the period of the holidays to make this a bit more polished/usable. Contributions welcome.\r\n\r\n`Disclaimers:` This was whipped up in roughly an hour. So its fairly primitive. Objective-C is not my first langugage and I would love to hear from the \"gurus\" about what are better ways of achieving this. \r\nMore importantly I want to know if doing such a thing(json for layouts/ remote layouts changing vies) even makes remote sense. \r\nThen there are Questions about whether this kind of code is acceptable from an Appstore Certification point of view.\r\n\r\nFor any feedback/query/suggestions/rants: kr.shaishav@gmail.com.
